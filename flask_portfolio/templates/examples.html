      <h1>Python Logbook</h1>
      <p>Date started - 11/16/2019<p>
      <p>I created the Python Logbook as a way for me to keep track of my thoughts and
        accomplishments while coding. When I'm at my computer, opening a terminal is super quick
        and easy, and I wanted to be able to create a logbook entry as quickly as possible
        without even moving my hands from the keyboard. I made this possible by utilizing a python
        script that would create a series of folders for me to store my entry in, depending on the date,
        and then create a file that was named with the time. When I open up the terminal and type "newlog",
        a series of folders are automatically created in a set directory and the terminal asks me what my
        entry will be. I quickly type my entry and then enter to save. I can then exit the terminal and then
        continue on with my work.</p>

      <p>Date started - 9/12/2019</p>
      <p> You're already here! I really like this website and am proud of the design
        that I created. I designed the site using Figma. This project also was the first time that
        I used Github. While creating this website I learned how to upload files to Github and use
        command-line git to manage my project. I learned how to use forks and how to push, pull, fetch
        and merge. I also learned how to use github pages to host my
        site.</p>
